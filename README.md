# Quill-textEditor
This Project contains the full implementation of Quill in the Next.js.
However, there is only one bug in this project on which currently I am
working: I am unable to add custom fonts in the text editor. If you find
any solution than, please update this repository and please send me the 
one with the solution or email my at: sibghatullah295295@gmail.com.
